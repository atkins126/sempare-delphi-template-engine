## Introduction

Template engines are used often in in the technology where text needs to be customised by substituting variables with values from a data source. Examples where this may take place:
- web sites using template engines (or languages)
- code generation
- mail merge 
- notification messages 

The Sempare Template Engine is a small templating engine for [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) (Object Pascal) that allows for templates to be created easily and efficiently by providing a simple and easy to use interface.

Example usage:
```
program Example;
uses
    Sempare.Template;
type
    TInformation = record
        name: string;
        favourite_sport : string;
        count : integer;
    end;
begin
    var tpl := Template.Parse(
	       'My name is <% name %>.'#13#10 + 
	       'My favourite sport is <% favourite_sport %>.'#13#10 + 
	       'Counting... <% for i := 1 to count %><% i %><% betweenitems %>, <% end %>'
	);
    var info : TInformation;
    info.name := 'conrad';
    info.favourite_sport := 'ultimate';
    info.count := 3;
    writeln(Template.Eval(tpl, info));	
end.
```

The project uses RTTI to allow for almost any type to be dereferenced.

In the example above, you can see that the '<%' start and '%>' end the scripting statement respectively. Within a scripting statement, you can reference variables, assign variables, use conditions, for and while loops, and include other templates.

**NOTE** In examples in this documentation I may use the latest Delphi syntax, e.g. inline variable declarations. This is not backward compatible as they were introduced in Delphi 10.2 and are used to shorten the code/examples being illustrated in the documentation. The codebase will attempt to be as backward compatible as possible.

## Call to action

Please 'star' the project on github.

## Quickstart

[Try the demo](./demo/VelocityDemo/README.md) if you want to dive in quick and play with the template engine.

Quick tutorials on [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjjz4SuVScHreGKEInvrjPtLPMBU6l130). 
The playlist has a few videos that are very short (most less than a minute - blink and they are done). You can drag the slider in the videos if you miss something or refer to the rest of the documentation.

- extensibile RTTI interface to easily dereference classes and interfaces (current customisations for ITemplateVariables, TDictionary, TJsonObject)

## Objectives

The Sempare Template Engine is not intended to be a fully featured general purpose programming language such as PHP where the script itself could be a self contained programming language (but it does have most of the features).

Sempare Template Engine aims to provide just enough functionality to allow you to easily work with the 'view' aspects of a template. Any enhanced functionality required from the scripting environment should be provided by the custom functions written in Pascal.

## Requirements

The template engine works with modern versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). 

Tests currently run using the DUnitX TestFramework.

An attempt has been made not to use the latest features to ease backward compatability. The following versions have been tested:

- Delphi XE 4
- Delphi XE 8
- Delphi 10.0 Seatle
- Delphi 10.1 Berlin
- Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
- Delphi 10.3.3 Rio
- Delphi 10.4 Sydney
- Delphi 11.0-11.2 Alexandria

There should be no platform specific restrictions.

Have a look at Sempare.Template.Compiler.inc. The following defines can be defined if appropriate:

- SEMPARE_TEMPLATE_FIREDAC - to support tests for TDataSet
- SEMPARE_TEMPLATE_NO_INDY - if Indy is not present. This is used to access an html encoder if TNetEncoding is not available.
- SEMPARE_TEMPLATE_CONFIRM_LICENSE - if present, you confirm you understand the conditions.

## Installation: GetIt

The Sempare Template Engine for Delphi can be installed via the [Embarcadero GetIt manager](https://getitnow.embarcadero.com/?q=sempare&product=rad-studio)

This will add the *src* folder to the search path so you can start working immediately.

## Installation: Delphinus-Support

The Sempare Template Engine for Delphi can be installed via the [Delphinus](https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus) package manager.

This will add the *src* folder to the search path so you can start working immediately.

### Using the Sempare Template Engine in your Delphi project

Start by adding the *src* folder to the Delphi search path. Otherwise, there are some projects you can use:

Open __Sempare.Template.Engine.Group.groupproj__ which will include:

- __Sempare.Template.Pkg.dproj__

  The core template project. (runtime)
     
- __Sempare.Template.Tester.dproj__

   100+ unit tests

- __demo\VelocityDemo\Sempare.Template.Demo.dproj__

   The velocity real-time demo.   
   
   
## Feedback

You can raise issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/sempare/sempare.template) and they will be addressed based on priority.

Most features have some basic tests in place. If a bug is been discovered, please include a basic test/scenario replicating the issue if possible as this will ease the investigation process.
