## Known restrictions / limitations / bugs

- basic arrays must be one dimensional

- numbers are limited to the regex format _[0-9]\([.][0-9]+)_.

- include/require could be functions, but are special and thus part of the grammar. 

- custom methods don't work with 'array of const'. See [Custom Functions](./custom-functions.md) for more information.

- users may need to cast types explitly when calling functions/methods or introduce custom methods to assist with casting.

- max run time is currently based on checking the time within loops. this does not however stop a function from blocking indefinitely.

- review __Sempare.Template.Compiler.inc__ to see conditional compilation
